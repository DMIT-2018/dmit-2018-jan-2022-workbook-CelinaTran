//Have connection string predefined for security .... will not be putting our stuff in this file when we start connecting to the db .. will be creating another json file that will be holding our connection string because we will be working in teams and not everyone will have the same name for their sql server ... will end up with conflicts if we're constantly switching up the server name... as a result we will be using user sequence -- if system cant find the connect string in app setting file it will look for a file called user sequence on your machine to find the server specified for your machine -- will not be tracked by github
